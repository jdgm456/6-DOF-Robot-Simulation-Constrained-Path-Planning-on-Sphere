## 🦾 UR5 Robot – End-Effector Circular Path Simulation
This project simulate the UR5 Robot's end effector tracing out a circular path on the surface of a sphere


## 🧩 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Model the UR5 Robot and it's corresponding DH parameters
- Have the end effector trace out a circle on the surface of a sphere
- Solve Inverse Kinematics for each discrete point on the spheres surface so that the end effector may trace out a smooth motion
- Visualize the motion and ensure the end effector remains normal to spheres surface always

## ⚙️ Concepts Demonstrated

- Homogeneous transformations
- Rotation about arbitrary axes
- Forward and inverse kinematics

## 🧰 Requirements

- MATLAB R2021b or later
- Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB
